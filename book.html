  <h1>The Book</h1>

  <p>
    This book presents <em>Web Prolog</em> — a distributed logic programming language 
    that brings together the symbolic reasoning power of Prolog and the 
    actor-based concurrency model of Erlang, and puts them to work on the open Web. 
    It covers the language itself, the <em>Prolog agent</em> abstraction, and the vision of 
    a programmable <em>Prolog Web</em>: a distributed infrastructure of nodes 
    communicating over HTTP and WebSocket, as open and interlinked as the Web itself.
