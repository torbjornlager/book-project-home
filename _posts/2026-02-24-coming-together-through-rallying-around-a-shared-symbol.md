A logotype gives a programming language a unique look and feel that makes it instantly
recognizable and easier to remember. It is more than just a nice design -- it is a way for
users to connect, feel part of a community, and rally around a shared symbol. The logo also
says something about what the language stands for, helping people get a quick sense of its
vibe. Plus, it is useful for spreading the word; a good logo can make the language more
visible in tutorials, online discussions, and conferences, making it stick in people's minds
and building a legacy over time. Here are the logotypes for four well-established languages:

By contrast, there is no Prolog logo broadly recognized across sub-communities. It may be
that lack of a formal logo is intended to make a statement, signaling that Prolog is academic
software? However, in recent years, even niche languages have started adopting logos as
branding and community-building become more central, especially in open-source and web-facing
contexts. I believe it is time for Prolog to follow suit.

Fortunately, we need not begin from scratch. The field of logic programming already possesses
an emblematic resource: the white-on-black geometric symbol at the heart of the logo for the
*Association for Logic Programming* (ALP).

Familiar to logicians, the three glyphs ⊨, ≡ and ⊢ stand for semantic entailment, logical
equivalence and syntactic inference, respectively. Though underutilized and perhaps
underrecognized, the equation expresses a core thesis of logic programming: that syntax and
semantics, process and meaning, are formally intertwined. The equation, while not fully
realized in practical Prolog, remains a guiding principle of logic programming -- and a
fitting philosophical emblem for Prolog. In the spirit of reuse and renewal, and adding 
a frame and a bit of color, I'd like to propose a Prolog logotype based on this symbol.

By replacing the name "Prolog" with the names of other
logic programming languages, and varying the color of the name and the frame, logotypes for
other languages implementing this paradigm can be formed.

Of course, the logos need to look 2025-modern, not 1995-modern, so these visual mockups need
to be professionally rendered if they are to be taken seriously.

Perception matters. A modern, compelling visual identity -- a Prolog logotype -- can serve
as a powerful symbol of unity, innovation, and shared purpose. It helps to present Prolog not
as a relic of the past, but as a forward-looking technology ready to tackle contemporary
challenges.
