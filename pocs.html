  <h1>Proof-of-Concept Implementations</h1>

  <p>
    Two proof-of-concept implementations of a Web Prolog node are available,
    both written in SWI-Prolog. They exist to demonstrate that the ideas described
    in the book are realizable, not to serve as production-ready systems. Neither
    is complete, and both should be read in conjunction with the book.
  </p>

  <h2>The Transparent Node</h2>

  <p>
    This implementation is written for clarity. The code is meant to be read
    alongside the book, and every design decision maps directly to a concept
    described there. As a result, a number of features are absent or only
    partially sketched out. It is the right starting point if your goal is to
    understand how Web Prolog nodes work from the inside.

  <h2>The Full-Featured Node</h2>

  <p>
    This implementation has been developed with breadth in mind. It covers a
    considerably larger portion of the language and protocol, including features
    that the transparent node deliberately omits. The code is more involved, and
    less suited as a first read, but it gives a more realistic picture of what a
    functioning Web Prolog node looks like in practice. Some features remain
    unimplemented here as well.
