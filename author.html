    <p>
      Torbjörn Lager is a professor emeritus of general and computational linguistics.
      His PhD is in linguistics, but he has spent most of his research and development
      in the field of computational linguistics, with a broad range of interests spanning
      tools for corpus linguistics, tools for machine learning, and platforms for the
      development of multimodal dialogue systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years he has nurtured a keen interest in Web Science, looking at the Web
      not only as a technical artefact but also as a social phenomenon. On the technical
      side, he has done web-related programming for fifteen years, mostly building research
      prototypes, and has given courses in web technology — in particular in his area of
      expertise, the Spoken Web (VoiceXML, SRGS, SSML). He is an invited expert in the
      W3C Voice Browser Working Group and is involved in the specification of
      State Chart XML (SCXML).
    </p>
    <p>
      He is also interested in the Semantic Web — a natural fit given his background in
      logic and logic programming. On the non-technical side of Web Science, he believes
      linguistics has an interesting perspective to offer. With a background in philosophy,
      he is drawn to the Philosophy of the Web and to the interactions of technology,
      science and the humanities in general.
