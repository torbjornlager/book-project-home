      Torbjörn Lager is Professor (emeritus) of General and Computational Linguistics
      at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science at the
      University of Gothenburg. Trained as a linguist, he has spent most of his career
      working where language, logic, programming, and artificial intelligence meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computational linguistics and language technology were long regarded as central
      areas of AI, and this perspective has shaped much of his work. Over the years he
      has built tools for corpus linguistics, experimented with machine learning, and
      developed platforms for multimodal dialogue systems. He has consistently preferred
      building working systems over merely theorising about them. He has been programming
      in Prolog since 1987, and logic programming has remained a constant thread
      throughout his career — not only as a tool, but as a way of thinking about
      computation and reasoning. While never a central figure within the Prolog
      community, he has applied Prolog extensively in dialogue systems, web prototypes,
      and research platforms, bringing a somewhat independent perspective to the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      His broader interest in programming languages has included systems such as Oz
      and its implementation model, particularly its approach to concurrency and
      declarative programming. For roughly two decades, his work has engaged with Web
      technology and aspects of Web Science. He has designed and implemented numerous
      web-based research prototypes and taught courses in web technologies, especially
      within the Spoken Web stack — VoiceXML, SRGS, and SSML. He has served as an
      invited expert in the W3C Voice Browser Working Group and has been involved in
      the specification of State Chart XML (SCXML).
    </p>
    <p>
      With a background in philosophy, he is interested in how the Web reshapes
      knowledge, communication, and the relationship between technology, science,
      and the humanities. The Prolog Trinity ecosystem is the outcome of this long
      and somewhat unconventional trajectory — an attempt to bring together logic
      programming, distributed systems, Web architecture, and symbolic AI into a
      coherent, web-native framework.
